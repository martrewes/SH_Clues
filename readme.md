# Clues App for 221B Baker Street

*Built using Cordova to use on Android*

I am now going to leave it as it is as it works fine for what I need it to do.

## Whats working so far:
- Project loads
- UI VERY barebones
- Input box and button
- Can search the first 10 clues of the book
- Refreshes after a set time

## Need to do 
#### Updated 22/02/2021
- [x] Hook into json file instead of the index
- [x] Move all of the script into it's own file
- [x] (Sort of) Make the UI Look nicer
- [x] Add a viable timer (possibly)
